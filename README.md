# dnd - Do not disturb

A rusty Windows program to turn on focus mode for a set amount of time. It also logs every invocation of this program.

It's mainly a tool for me so that I can type things like

```
dnd 30m hard at work
```

and then not get disturbed for 30 minutes. And later down the road, I can check the logs to see how long I probably worked.
